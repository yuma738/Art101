    hi my name is ashley she/her pronouns 
    I am a fourth year agpm major was a transfer last year. 
    I have some coding experience 
    while I was in community college and my last year 
    of high school. now I have forgot some of it. 
    I mostly struggle with fixing bugs when coding. 
    I like to play video games such as jrpg, rpgs, rhythm games,
    platforming games, and gacha games. the profile is picture of 
    two of my favorite characters that i like that relate to me the most. 
    Akito and kohane are from the same game called project sekai 
    one is a shy girl who became confident and got better on her skills. 
    the other guy he is competitve on the goals he wants to achieve and 
    trys hard on everything he does which can relate to me the most as i 
    try hard on everything i do too. they are both in the same unit called 
    vivid bad squad. a unit group in the game trying to surpass a legend 
    called rad weekend.
